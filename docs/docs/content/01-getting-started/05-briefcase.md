# Packaging the GUI with Briefcase

This project uses [BeeWare's Briefcase](https://beeware.org) to generate
platformâ€‘native installers. Once your development environment is set up,
package the GUI by running the following commands from the repository root:

```bash
# Create the application scaffold for your platform
briefcase create

# Compile dependencies and produce a distributable bundle
briefcase build

# Run the packaged application
briefcase run
```

`briefcase create` only needs to be executed once per platform. After the
initial creation step you can repeatedly run `briefcase build` followed by
`briefcase run` to test your packaged application on Windows, macOS or Linux.
